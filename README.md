# Online-Mixer
An audio mixer you can run in your browser.

This project is primarily intended as a medium for the presentation of my senior work in music. The multitracks will be available to manipulate in a manner similar to an analog mixer, with plugins and other effects available as well. The accompanying website will host this interface, with the idea that anyone can run it in a browser on any device. Compatability will be confirmed as the project is developed.
